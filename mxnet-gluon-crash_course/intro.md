# Gluon in 60 seconds

Apache MXNet and the Gluon interface provide a declarative and imperative
interface to a complete Deep Learning and machine learning framework.  In this
module you will take a crash course to trial the Gluon interface and build a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and classify the class MNIST data
set.  For more tutorials please stay tuned to Katacoda and visit the home
